# Twilight-Forest-Ftbquests
A simple Twilight Forest Ftbquests make by myself

# How do I use it?
Just download the file and unzip it to "\config\ftbquests\normal\chapters".

Modify the "index.snbt" file, add the name of the task folder.

For example, the folder name for this task is "fbd29afb".

The contents of the "index.snbt" file look like this:

	{
	    index: [
	        "fbd29afb"
	    ]
	}


# Can I modify these tasks?
Sure, since I didn't add any mission rewards, feel free to change them.
