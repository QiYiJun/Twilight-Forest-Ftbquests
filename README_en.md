A simple Twilight Forest Ftbquests make by myself.<br>
语言: [中文](https://github.com/QiYiJun/Twilight-Forest-Ftbquests/blob/main/README_zh.md)

# How do I use it?
Just download the file and unzip it to "\config\ftbquests\normal\chapters".<br>
Modify the "index.snbt" file, add the name of the task folder.<br>
For example, the folder name for this task is "fbd29afb".<br>
The contents of the "index.snbt" file look like this:

	{
	    index: [
	        "fbd29afb"
	    ]
	}

# Can I modify these tasks?
Sure, since I didn't add any mission rewards, feel free to change them.

# FAQ
Not yet, it seems.
